# Bare metal code examples for Allwinner's F1C100S (F1C200S) SOC

These examples work without any operating system environment. It's like programming simple microcontrollers or "old school" programming techniques. Examples can be used for educational purposes to teach low-level programming. All programs can be run on [f1c_dbc](https://github.com/minilogic/f1c_dbc) computer or [Lichee Nano](https://linux-sunxi.org/LicheePi_Nano) demoboard.
Low-level framework is simple, but provides the following features:
- work with graphic display modules: TV, TFT, HDMI (work in progress);
- examples of working with communication interfaces: UART, SPI, I2C;
- playback and recording with built-in hardware audio codec;
- USB Device/Host driver implementation;
- ÂµSD memory card support;
- bootloader implementation from SPI-flash memory;
- examples of integrating third-party libraries: FatFs, LVGL, LWIP, TinyGL, MP3 Decoder/Encoder...
