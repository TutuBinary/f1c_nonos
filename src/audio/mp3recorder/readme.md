# MP3 recorder

Example of mp3-encoding from microphone input of the built-in audio codec. The [Shine MP3-Encoder](http://gabriel.mp3-tech.org) library was used. This program allows you to record audio to a file with different sampling rates and bit rates. During recording, the processor load is measured.
