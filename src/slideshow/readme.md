# Slideshow Demo

This is a simple implementation of a slideshow of `.jpg` files located on a microSD memory card in the `wallpapers` directory. Single-file library [stb_image.h](https://github.com/nothings/stb) was used to decode jpg-files. Working with the file system is implemented through the [FatFs](http://elm-chan.org/fsw/ff/00index_e.html) library.
